# Red Black Tree
Red Black Tree implementation.

Rules:
1.  Each `Node` must be either RED or Black
2.  The root of the tree must ALWAYS be Black
3.  Two RED nodes can never appear in a row within the tree; a RED node must always have a BLACK parent node, and BLACK child nodes
4.  Every branch path from the root node in the tree to a NULL leaf passes through the exact same number of black nodes. (This is also an unsuccessful search path)
